                <h5> Why We Start? </h5>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh is an agriculture based country. Nowadays we are nearly food sufficient but safe or quality food is a question. In our conventional system most of the producers, handlers, whole salers, retailaers at different stages in the distribution chain are knowingly or unknowingly using harmful chemicals to grow, process and preserve foods which is detrimental to health. As an example farmers are known to use antibiotic, growth promoter, toxic pesticides containing Organo Chlorinate, Mercury, Lead, Chromium, Organo Phosphate, coloring agent and numerous other hazardous poisonous chemicals to ensure maximum production all year long. These chemicals cause hazardous damage to our health resulting in cancer, kidney failure, infertility and various health problem. But the positive scenerio is that nowadays the awarness is raising among the producers & consumers about food safety.
